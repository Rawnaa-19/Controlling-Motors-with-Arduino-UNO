## Introduction
The second task for the Electronics and Power Department is controlling motors using Arduino UNO. There are two types of motors in this task: servo motors, which rotate 180 degrees, and DC motors, which can move in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction. 
## Servo Motor
The servo motor is an electrical device that rotates machines and robots in an angular direction.(The Purpose of Servo Motors | Fuji Electric Product Column | Fuji Electric Global, n.d.)
### Sweep 
Here the servo motor is controlled using Arduino UNO.

4. Breadboard
#### Circuit Wiring
The servo motor has 3 wires (Vcc , Ground ,and Signal).The Vcc "Red" wire is connected to the 5V pin in the Arduino through the breadboard, the Ground "black" wire is connected to the GND "Ground" pin in the Arduino through the breadboard, and the signal "yellow" wire is connected to the 2 pin in the Arduino through the breadboard.
