## Introduction
The second task for the Electronics and Power Department is controlling motors using Arduino UNO. There are two types of motors in this task: servo motors, which rotate 180 degrees, and DC motors, which can move in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction. 
## Servo Motor
The servo motor is an electrical device that rotates machines and robots in an angular direction.(The Purpose of Servo Motors | Fuji Electric Product Column | Fuji Electric Global, n.d.)
